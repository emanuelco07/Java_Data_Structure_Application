# Java_Data_Structure_Application

A collaborative Software Engineering project developed by 3rd-year Computer Science students at the Petroleum-Gas University of Ploiesti. This application integrates four distinct data structure problems into a single, intuitive Java Swing GUI.

## Overview

The core objective of this project was to implement complex data structures (Binary Trees, Queues, Linked Lists) from scratch, without relying on the standard `java.util.Collections` library. The project follows a modular architecture, focusing on the "Waterfall" development model and procedural programming paradigm.

### Key Features & Modules

*   **Queue of Queues (Valentin):** Converts a matrix into a hierarchical queue structure.
*   **Set Operations (Bianca):** Performs Union (Tree-based) and Intersection (Queue-based) between two sets.
*   **Node Classification (Andrei):** Analyzes and categorizes binary tree nodes based on their number of children (0, 1, or 2).
*   **Root-to-Leaf Paths (Emanuel):** Identifies and displays all possible paths from the root to the leaves in a binary tree.
